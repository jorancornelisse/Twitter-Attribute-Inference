# Twitter-Attribute-Inference
Age &amp; Gender Prediction

This repository contains the scripts I used for pre-processing Twitter data, model selection plus hyperparameter tuning, and finally predicting age
and gender on Twitter. The age and gender scripts contain the SAGE and TF-IGM algorithms. 
For the SAGE analysis, I want to give acknowledgements to Eisenstein et al. (2011): https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/SAGE.
As for data collecting, I attained the data through Mysocialdatabase.com (https://mysocialdatabase.com/), 
who follow the Twitter API guidelines: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/overview.
